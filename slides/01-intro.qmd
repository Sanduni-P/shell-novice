# Episode 1: Introducing the Shell {.nonincremental}

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" .nonincremental}
## Questions

- What is a command shell and why would I use one?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" .nonincremental}
## Objectives

- Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.
- Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.
:::

## Why Use the Shell?

### The Problem with GUIs

Imagine: Copy the 3rd line from 1,000 text files across 1,000 folders into one file.

::: {.fragment}
**Using a GUI:**

- Hours of clicking
- High chance of error
- Repetitive and tedious
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Using the Shell:**

- A few commands
- Repeatable
- Fast and accurate (seconds!)
:::

## What is the Shell?

::: {.incremental}
- A **program** that reads commands you type
- A **command-line interface (CLI)** - text-based
- Also a **scripting language** for automation
- Allows combining simple programs into powerful workflows
- The default way to interact with servers and supercomputers
:::

## Bash: The Shell We're Using

**Bash** = **B**ourne **A**gain **S**Hell

::: {.incremental}
- Most popular Unix shell
- Default on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via Git Bash)
- The standard for shell scripting
- Small number of "words" (commands) gets you far!
:::

## The Prompt

When you open the shell, you see:

```bash
$
```

The prompt indicates the shell is **waiting for input**.

::: {.callout-note}
Your prompt might look different:
```bash
nelle@localhost $
```
or even:

```bash
user@computer:~$
```

This shows your username and computer name.
:::

## Typing Commands

::: {.incremental}
- **Type** a command after the `$`
- **Press Enter** to execute
- Results appear below
- **Never type the `$`** - it's just the prompt!
:::

## Example: Your First Command

::: {.nonincremental}
- `ls` is short for listing.
- This command will list the contents of the current directory:
:::

```bash
ls
```

```output
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

::: {.fragment}

::: {.callout-caution}

## Command not found

If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
will print an error message such as:

```bash
ks
```

```output
ks: command not found
```

This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command
is not installed.

## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

### 🧪 The Scenario

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has:

-  🌊 Returned from a 6-month North Pacific Gyre survey
-   🧫 Collected 1520 samples
-   🧬 Measured 300 proteins per sample
-   💻 Needs to process all files using `goostats.sh`
-   📝 Must submit her paper by the end of the month

## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

### 🚨 The Challenge

If Nelle runs `goostats.sh` manually (GUI):

-  Open & process 1520 files
-  ⏱ 30 seconds per file
-  🕒 12+ hours of manual work
-  ❌ Time lost that could be spent writing her paper

## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

### 💡 The Solution: Use the Shell

With a command shell, Nelle can:

- Automate repetitive processing
- Use loops to iterate over files
-   Run the pipeline once and reuse it
-   Let the computer work while she writes


## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

### 🛠 Skills Nelle Needs

To build her pipeline, she must know how to:

-   Navigate to a file/directory
-   Create a file/directory
-   Check the length of a file
-   Chain commands together
-   Retrieve a set of files
-   Iterate over files
-   Run a shell script containing her pipeline
