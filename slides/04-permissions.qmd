## File Permissions {.nonincremental}

Every file/folder has permissions defining who can access them

Three permission categories:

- **owner** - applies only to file owner
- **group** - applies only to assigned group
- **all users** - applies to all other users (watch this closely!)

### Permission Example

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><td></td><th>user</th><th>group</th><th>all</th></tr>
<tr><th>read</th><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><th>write</th><td>yes</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><th>execute</th><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
</table>

## Viewing Permissions

View file permissions with `ls -l`:

```bash
cd alkanes
ls -l methane.pdb
```

```output
-rw-r--r--  1 nelle  bio   422B  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
```

### Understanding `ls -l` Output {.nonincremental}


1. A set of ten permission flags
2. Link count (which is irrelevant to this course)
3. The owner of the file
4. The associated group
5. The size of the file in bytes
6. The date that the file was last modified
7. The name of the file

## Permission Flags

Three basic permission types:

- **Read (r)** - capability to read file contents
- **Write (w)** - capability to write/modify files or directories
- **Execute (x)** - capability to execute files or view directory contents

### Permission String Structure

```output
-rw-r--r--  1 nelle  bio   422B  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
```

- **First character** - special permission flag (e.g., `d` = directory)
- **First `rw-`** - owner permissions
- **Second `r--`** - group permissions
- **Third `r--`** - all users permissions

## Users and Groups

::: {.callout-note}

## On users and groups

When listing the contents of a directory you may come across files that 
have the same text for both the user and group.
An example of this is in the output: 

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 nelle  nelle   422B  1 Sep  2019 test.txt
```

In Linux, users will usually have a group associated with them that shares the same name that the user does. 
While this can seem strange, make sure that you understand the difference in the output so you 
know who has access to your files.

## Can you spot the difference here? What does it mean?

Let's take a look at some files in a different folder.

```bash
cd Desktop/data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
ls -l
```

```output
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4406  8 Aug  2019 NENE01729A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4400  8 Aug  2019 NENE01729B.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4371  8 Aug  2019 NENE01736A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4411  8 Aug  2019 NENE01751A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4409  8 Aug  2019 NENE01751B.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4401  8 Aug  2019 NENE01812A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4395  8 Aug  2019 NENE01843A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4375  8 Aug  2019 NENE01843B.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4372  8 Aug  2019 NENE01971Z.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4381  8 Aug  2019 NENE01978A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4389  8 Aug  2019 NENE01978B.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  3517  8 Aug  2019 NENE02018B.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4391  8 Aug  2019 NENE02040A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4367  8 Aug  2019 NENE02040B.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4381  8 Aug  2019 NENE02040Z.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4386  8 Aug  2019 NENE02043A.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio  4393  8 Aug  2019 NENE02043B.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 nelle  bio   345  8 Aug  2019 goodiff
-rwxr-xr-x 1 nelle  bio   218  8 Aug  2019 goostats
```

The data files in this folder, e.g `NENE01978A.txt` have a different permission set to `goodiff`. Can you tell why this is and explain what this might mean for the `goodiff` file?

:::

## Solution

::: {.callout-tip .solution-callout collapse="true" icon="false" style="border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;"}

## Solution

The `goodiff` file has the execution flags set for user, group and all. Which will allow anyone to execute the file. It's therefore likely that `goodiff` is a script that performs some actions. In theory you could run this script using `./goodiff`

## Challenge

## Challenge

Lets take a further look at things by looking at in the folder above this.

```bash
cd ..
ls -l
```

```output
drwxr-xr-x 21 nelle  bio  672  8 Aug  2019 2012-07-03
```

Can you guess what the `d` at the beginning of the output line means?

:::

## Solution

::: {.callout-tip .solution-callout collapse="true" icon="false" style="border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;"}

## Solution

The `d` indicates whether the file has any special type associated with it. In this case it's indicating that this is a directory.

:::

## Modifying Permissions

- We want to modify access to files in the `alkanes/` directory.
- Assume we are members of the `bio` group on this system.
- On clusters, groups are commonly used to share files within a lab.

### Groups Note

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}

## Groups

You'll find that if you try to assign a group to a file and the group does not exist you'll get something similar to the following output.

```output
chown: bio: illegal group name
```

If you're trying to do this locally, you can list the groups you're currently a member of using the `groups` command like so:

```bash
groups
```

Just pick one of these groups to demonstrate the method shown below.

:::

## Using `chown`

Change ownership to allow `compbio` group to read file:

```bash
cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes
chown nelle:compbio methane.pdb
```

- **chown** - command
- **nelle** - user
- **compbio** - group
- **methane.pdb** - filename

Re-running `ls -l` shows the ownership change:

```output
total 48
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1158  8 Aug  2019 cubane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio     622  8 Aug  2019 ethane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  compbio 422  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1828  8 Aug  2019 octane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1226  8 Aug  2019 pentane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio     825  8 Aug  2019 propane.pdb
```

## Changing Permissions with `chmod`

- `chmod` = change mode = change permissions
- Allow members of the group to make changes to `methane.pdb`, but not others.
- To explicitly define permissions, reference the **Permission Group** and **Permission Types**.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Permission Groups

- **u** - User/Owner
- **g** - Group
- **o** - Other / All Users
- **a** - All Groups (Owner, Group and All Users)

:::



::: {.column width="50%"}

### Permission Types

- **r** - Read
- **w** - Write
- **x** - Execute

- Assignment operators:
	- `+` adds permissions
	- `-` removes permissions
:::

::::

## `chmod` - Remove - Other Read {.nonincremental}

To remove the ability for other users to read the `methane.pdb` file,

```bash
chmod o-r methane.pdb
```


```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1158  8 Aug  2019 cubane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio     622  8 Aug  2019 ethane.pdb
-rw-r----- 1 nelle  compbio 422  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1828  8 Aug  2019 octane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1226  8 Aug  2019 pentane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio     825  8 Aug  2019 propane.pdb
```

The **r** flag removed from other users section.

## `chmod` - Add Group Write

Allow group members to write/edit:

```bash
chmod g+w methane.pdb
```

Checking this has gone through using `ls -l`:

```output
total 48
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1158  8 Aug  2019 cubane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio     622  8 Aug  2019 ethane.pdb
-rw-rw---- 1 nelle  compbio 422  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1828  8 Aug  2019 octane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio    1226  8 Aug  2019 pentane.pdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 nelle  bio     825  8 Aug  2019 propane.pdb
```

## Changing permissions for all files in a directory?

Say we want to change the permissions for all the files in the `alkanes/` directory, how we would do this? Let's try and give apply what we've just learnt to give all other users write permissions over the files.

:::


## Solution

::: {.callout-tip .solution-callout collapse="true" icon="false" style="border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;"}

## Solution

There's actually a few ways we can go about this and it really depends on how we target the files to change. First, we could use the wildcards we learnt about previously to target files based on a specific pattern. In this case a simple `*` would suffice to pick out every file in the current folder, e.g:

```bash
chmod o+w *
```

We could also use the recursive flag available to the `chmod` command to run through every file in a directory **(including sub-directories)** and apply a set of permissions to every file. E.g:

```bash
cd ..
chmod -R o+w alkanes/
```

Either method works in this case, however be wary that as the `-R` flag works through the folder and all sub-folders, you may end up changing the permission on something you didn't intend.

:::

## Using Binary References to Set Permissions {.nonincremental}

- Another way to set the permission using **binary references**. 
- This replaces the explicitly defined permissions with binary references to these.
- While more complex than the previous method, we can use this to define multiple different permissions to all three permissions groups with a single command.

## Binary References Example

An example permission string would be `chmod 764 methane.pdb`, which means:

![](../episodes/fig/binary-perm.png){fig-align="center"}

- the owner has read, write and execute permissions
- the group has read and write permissions
- all other users have read permissions to the file


## Challenge

::: {.callout-note .challenge-callout icon="false" style="border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;"}

## Using binary references, how can you make a file executable?

Now we've seen how to use binary references to change permissions on a file. Can you change the `methane.pdb` file to make it executable? In this case, you can't actually execute the file as it doesn't contain the right data to do this, but it will teach you how to do this for other files in future, most notably scripts.

:::


## Solution

::: {.callout-tip .solution-callout collapse="true" icon="false" style="border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;"}

## Solution
To ensure that we don't make unintended changes to the other permissions currently assigned to the 
file, we need to first check what permissions it currently has
```bash
ls -l methane.pdb
```

```output
-rw-r--r--  1 nelle  compbio   422B  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
```

We can see that both the read permission flags are set for groups and others. This makes creating the binary reference here easy as we only need to take the integer 4 for both these flags.

Now we have the end of the binary reference, we need to add up the rest to give execute permissions to the file. As we already have read and write permissions as the owner of the file, we only need to add 1 to the binary reference to get 7. Therefore, the full binary reference we need to set is 744.

```bash
cd ..
chmod 744 methane.pdb
```

```output
-rwxr--r--  1 nelle  compbio   422B  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
```

Here, the first 7 assigns **read, write, execute** to owner, the first 4 adds **read** to the group, and the last 4 adds **read** permissions to others.

:::

## Necessary But Not Sufficient

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}

The fact that something is marked as executable doesn't actually mean it contains a runnable program. Marking an HTML file executable won't make it run as a program; the OS may instead open it in the associated application.

:::

## Directory Permissions

- Run `ls -a -l` to show a long listing, including hidden directories:

```bash
ls -a -l
```

```output
total 48
drwxr-xr-x 1 nelle  bio        0  8 Aug  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 nelle  bio     8192  8 Aug  2019 ..
-rw-r--rw- 1 nelle  bio     1158  8 Aug  2019 cubane.pdb
-rw-r--rw- 1 nelle  bio      622  8 Aug  2019 ethane.pdb
-rwxr--r-- 1 nelle  compbio  422  8 Aug  2019 methane.pdb
-rw-r--rw- 1 nelle  bio     1828  8 Aug  2019 octane.pdb
-rw-r--rw- 1 nelle  bio     1226  8 Aug  2019 pentane.pdb
-rw-r--rw- 1 nelle  bio      825  8 Aug  2019 propane.pdb
```

- The permissions for `.` and `..` (this directory and its parent) start with a `d`.
- **'x'** means that "execute" is turned on.
- A directory isn't a program—how can we "run" it?
- It gives someone the right to **traverse** the directory, but not to look at its contents.

## Nelle's Directory Example

Nelle's home directory has three subdirectories called `venus`, `mars`, and `pluto`:

![](../episodes/fig/x-for-directories.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

- Each has a `notes` subdirectory, and those contain files.

## Scenario 1: `r-x` on venus

![](../episodes/fig/x-for-directories.png){height="400" fig-align="center"}

- With `venus` permissions set to **`r-x`**, she can list both `venus` and `venus/notes`.

## Scenario 2: `r--` on mars

![](../episodes/fig/x-for-directories.png){height="400" fig-align="center"}

- With `mars` permissions set to **`r--`**, she can read both `mars` and `mars/notes`.

## Scenario 3: `--x` on pluto

![](../episodes/fig/x-for-directories.png){height="400" fig-align="center"}

- With `pluto` permissions set to **`--x`**, `ls pluto` fails because she cannot view its contents.

- She can still access `pluto/notes` by traversing `pluto`.
- `--x` allows **traversal** but not directory listing.
